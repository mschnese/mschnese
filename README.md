## Hi there 👋 I'm Matt!

I'm an undergrad mechanical engineering student with a double major in aerospace engineering at UCCS, and i'm entering the 4th year of my 5 year degree program.
My main interests are thermofluids, aerodynamics, and modeling/simulation. After graduating, I plan on either entering gradschool with a focus on fluids or enter the defence and aerospace industry.


## Projects:

### 🔧 In Progress:

- ⚾ Pitch flight modeling from frame video analysis (independant):
  Multivaraite model created using induced verticle break, induced horizontal break, spin-to-velo ratio, and distance as parameters with 180 datapoints per parameter for each of 4 pitch types (fastball, curveball, slider, splitter/changeup).
  
- 💨 CFD analysis (independant):
  analyzing an airfoil for multiple angles of attack using openFOAM, and noting observations

### ✔ Completed:

- 🚁 Assembly of a Drone (independant):
  3d modeled and printed drone frame, optomized BOM, created metrics of success and timeline for project, ran tests on drone frame in FEA and real life, and documented entire project
  
- 🤖 creation of a PID using simulink for an actuator system:
  Created PID from a state space model with 4 criteria of success for the final project of my controls class.

- 📊 analysis of the accuracy of 6 ODE solvers:
  Created a 10 page technical report comparing the accuracy of the implicit and explicit Euler's methods, 2nd and 4th order Runge-Kutta, 4th order Adams-Bashforth, and 4th order Adams-Moulton for accuracy between methods and accuracy between step sizes for one method.

## 🛠️ Skills:
- Programming: MATLAB, Python, C#
- Tools: SOLIDWORKS, LTSpice, COMSOL, Simulink
- Instrumentation: Instrumentation: Oscilloscope, Ohmmeter, Voltmeter, Breadboard, DAQ
- Other Tools: MS Office Suite, Soldering, Additive Manufacturing

## 💡 Future Goals:
- Take graguate level MODSIM, Engineering Methods 2, and CFD before graduating
- Complete all future projects and publish them here
